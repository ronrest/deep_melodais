## Music Terminology
**Disclaimer :** I am not a musician, so I apologize if I am butchering 
the following definitions. 

- **Melody :** Melody can be thought of as the set of notes that you 
  most associate with the tune of some music. 
- **Harmony :** Harmony can be though of as notes that don't actually 
  carry the tune, but which adds support to it, and makes it stand out 
  more. 
- **Monophonic :** This refers to when a max of a single note is played 
  at each timestep.
- **Chord :** A chord is a combination of notes played at once, which 
  sound well together.
