## Music Terminology
**Disclaimer :** I am not a musician, so I apologize if I am butchering 
the following definitions. 

- **Melody :** Melody can be thought of as the set of notes that you 
  most associate with the tune of some music. 
- **Harmony :** Harmony can be though of as notes that don't actually 
  carry the tune, but which adds support to it, and makes it stand out 
  more. 
- **Monophonic :** This refers to when a max of a single note is played 
  at each timestep.
- **Chord :** A chord is a combination of notes played at once, which 
  sound well together. 


## Similarity to Natural Language
In natural languages, we have a finite vocabulary of words to chose 
from. We can think of these as fairly basic units of meaning. We 
can communicate ideas by putting combinations of words together in 
a specific sequence. 

The equivalent of words in music are notes. There is a finite number of 
notes we could chose from. We can combine these notes in a sequence to 
create music. 

In both natural language and music, how the sequence of units is 
selected is very important. If a sequence of words is not selected 
properly, then you will fail to communicate a meaningful statement. 
Similarly, if a sequence of notes is not selected carefully, then it 
will not create something we would consider music.
